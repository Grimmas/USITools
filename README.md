Shared components for KSP mods.

## USITools

This is the main assembly in this repo and is a dependency of nearly ever other mod in the USI cinematic universe. Some features of USITools:

- MANY PartModules for things like...
  - Airbags
  - Submersibles
  - Resource converters with swappable recipes
  - Resource and power distribution to nearby vessels
  - Robotic parts
  - ...and more
- Custom skill traits for Kerbals
- A resource and texture switching system
- A dependency injection system to facilitate unit testing, manage singletons, etc.
- A UI window manager (see `USIToolsUI`)

## USIToolsUI

**New for 2021!**

This is a collection of interfaces and MonoBehaviours to facilitate the use of [Unity UI](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/UIToolkits.html) in KSP. This assembly is designed to be used with the `WindowManager` class in `USITools`.

> Developer Notes:
> `USIToolsUI` does not and should not reference `USITools`.
>
> It is safe for your UI controllers to reference `USIToolsUI` but should not reference `USITools` or any other KSP assembly. Any references to objects in KSP assemblies (or assemblies that reference KSP assemblies) should be passed in to your UI controllers by reference at runtime.
